2.2. Extraction and Purification of Polysaccharides
2.2.1. Crude Polysaccharide Extraction
Dried Astragalus membranaceus roots (3 kg) were immersed in 95% industrial ethanol (liquid-to-solid ratio 5:1, v/w) to completely submerge the material, and defatted for 2 weeks at room temperature with ethanol renewed once on day 7. The defatted residue was filtered and air-dried in a well-ventilated fume hood for 48 h to remove residual ethanol. The dried residue was transferred to a 50 L stainless steel extraction tank and subjected to sequential hot water extraction: 30 L of boiling deionized water was added, and extraction was performed at 100°C for 4 h per cycle, repeated 8 times. All aqueous extracts were combined and concentrated to ~5 L using a rotary evaporator (60°C, 0.08 MPa). The concentrated extract was dispensed into 3500 Da MWCO dialysis bags and dialyzed against running tap water for 3 days, with water replaced every 8 h to remove low-molecular-weight impurities. After dialysis, the retentate was further concentrated to ~2 L, then centrifuged at 8000 rpm (7000×g) for 15 min at 4°C to remove insoluble particles. The supernatant was mixed with 3 volumes of 95% ethanol (v/v) and stored at 4°C overnight for alcohol precipitation. The mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min, and the precipitate was collected, washed twice with anhydrous ethanol, and oven-dried at 60°C for 12 h to remove residual ethanol. The dried material was redissolved in deionized water (1:10, w/v), freeze-dried, and designated as crude polysaccharide AM.
2.2.2. Polysaccharide Purification 
Crude polysaccharide AM (40 g) was dissolved in 400 mL deionized water at 4°C for 12 h with stirring, followed by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 15 min to remove insoluble residues. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE Sepharose™ Fast Flow column (5 × 50 cm) pre-equilibrated with deionized water. Elution was performed stepwise with deionized water, 0.05 M, 0.1 M, 0.2 M, 0.4 M, and 0.8 M NaCl solutions at a flow rate of 100 mL/min. Fractions (500 mL) were collected every 3 min using an automatic collector (BSZ-10), and sugar content was monitored by the phenol-sulfuric acid method at 490 nm. Six major fractions were pooled: AMW (water-eluted), AM005 (0.05 M NaCl), AM01 (0.1 M NaCl), AM02 (0.2 M NaCl), AM04 (0.4 M NaCl), and AM08 (0.8 M NaCl). Each fraction was concentrated by rotary evaporation, dialyzed against deionized water (MWCO 3,500 Da) for 48 h with water changes every 12 h, and lyophilized. Fraction AM005 was purified on a Sephacryl S-200 HR column (2.6 × 100 cm), while AM01 and AM02 were purified on a Sephacryl S-300 HR column (2.6 × 100 cm). Columns were pre-equilibrated with 0.2 M NaCl. Samples (200 mg) dissolved in 4 mL deionized water were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min, and supernatants loaded onto columns. Elution was carried out with 0.2 M NaCl at 5–6 mL/15 min. Fractions collected every 15 min were analyzed by phenol-sulfuric acid assay. Homogeneous fractions were pooled, dialyzed (MWCO 3,500 Da, 48 h), and lyophilized to obtain purified polysaccharides.

2.3. Structural Characterization
2.3.1. Molecular Weight and Homogeneity Determination
High-performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC) was performed on an Agilent 1260 HPLC system equipped with a KS-G 6B guard column (Shodex, Japan) and two tandem analytical columns: KS-802 (8.0 mm × 300 mm, exclusion limit 1.7 × 10⁵ Da) and KS-804 (8.0 mm × 300 mm, exclusion limit 4 × 10⁵ Da) (Shodex, Japan). The mobile phase was 0.1 M NaNO₃, prepared by dissolving 17.0 g sodium nitrate in 2 L ultrapure water, filtering through a 0.45 μm aqueous membrane, and sonicating for 30 min to remove dissolved gases. Chromatographic conditions: column temperature 40°C, RID temperature 40°C, flow rate 0.5 mL/min, and injection volume 10 μL.
Dextran standards (1, 5, 12, 25, 50, 150, 410, 600 kDa) were dissolved in the mobile phase to a concentration of 4 mg/mL, vortexed, centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min, and filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane. A calibration curve was established by plotting log molecular weight against retention time. Samples were prepared to 10 mg/mL in mobile phase, processed identically to standards, and injected. Homogeneity was confirmed by a single symmetric peak, and weight-average molecular weight (M<sub>w</sub>) was calculated using the calibration curve.
2.3.2. Physicochemical Properties
Neutral sugars were quantified by phenol-sulfuric acid assay using glucose standards (0–150 μg/mL). Samples/standards (100 μL) were mixed with 400 μL 5% phenol and 2 mL concentrated H₂SO₄, vortexed, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and measured at 490 nm (standard curve: y = 0.0058x + 0.012, R² = 0.999). Protein content was determined via BCA assay with BSA standards (0–50 μg/mL). Samples/standards (25 μL) were combined with 100 μL BCA reagent (A:B=100:1), incubated at 37°C for 30 min, and measured at 562 nm (standard curve: y = 0.018x + 0.035, R² = 0.998). Uronic acids were analyzed by m-hydroxydiphenyl method with galacturonic acid standards (0–150 μg/mL). Samples/standards (100 μL) were mixed with 2 mL borax-H₂SO₄ reagent, heated at 100°C for 5 min, ice-cooled, reacted with 100 μL 0.15% m-hydroxydiphenyl (in 0.5% NaOH), incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and measured at 520 nm (standard curve: y = 0.0072x + 0.021, R² = 0.997).
2.3.3. Monosaccharide Composition Analysis
Polysaccharide samples (2 mg) underwent acid hydrolysis with 2 mL 4 M TFA at 121°C for 2 h in sealed tubes. Excess TFA was removed by co-evaporation with methanol (3 × 5 mL) under reduced pressure. Hydrolyzates were reconstituted in 200 μL ultrapure water. Monosaccharide standards included D-Man, L-Rha, D-GlcA, D-GalA, D-Glc, D-Gal, L-Xyl, L-Ara, and L-Fuc. For PMP derivatization, 50 μL hydrolyzate was mixed sequentially with 50 μL 0.6 M NaOH and 100 μL 0.5 M PMP (methanol solution), incubated at 70°C for 100 min, quenched with 100 μL 0.3 M HCl, and diluted to 1 mL with ultrapure water. Chloroform extraction (1 mL × 3) was performed, and the aqueous phase filtered (0.22 μm). HPLC separation used a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm) at 35°C with 0.1 M KH₂PO₄ buffer (pH 6.7)-acetonitrile (83:17, v/v) mobile phase at 1 mL/min. Detection at 254 nm with 10 μL injection volume. Monosaccharide standards were derivatized identically, and molar ratios calculated by peak area normalization.
2.3.4. Methylation Analysis
Polysaccharides (7–10 mg) were vacuum-dried overnight, dissolved in 2 mL anhydrous DMSO (60°C if insoluble), and methylated under N₂ protection by sequential addition of 100 mg NaOH powder (stirred, 2 h, RT) and 1.5 mL CH₃I (dropwise, ice bath, 30 min), followed by stirring in the dark at 25°C for 2.5 h (solution color transition: pale yellow → milky white). The reaction was quenched with 1.5 mL H₂O, rotary-evaporated, dialyzed (MWCO 3,500 Da, 24 h, water changed every 8 h), and lyophilized. Methylation was repeated 2–3 times until complete.
2.3.5. Alditol Acetate Derivatization for Linkage Analysis
Methylated products were hydrolyzed with 4 M TFA (121°C, 2 h). Hydrolyzates were reduced with 100 mg NaBH₄ (RT, 3 h), neutralized with 25% acetic acid, and acetylated with 2 mL acetic anhydride (100°C, 1.5 h). Excess reagents were removed by co-evaporation with toluene (3×5 mL). Derivatives were partitioned in chloroform/water (1:1), washed with water (3×), dried over anhydrous Na₂SO₄, filtered (0.22 μm), and analyzed by GC-MS on a TG-5MS column (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) with He carrier gas (1 mL/min).
2.3.6. Partial Acid Hydrolysis
Polysaccharide solutions (10 mg/mL) were hydrolyzed with 0.1 M TFA (100°C, 1 h). After methanol co-evaporation to remove acid, hydrolyzates were dialyzed (MWCO 3,500 Da, 48 h, water changed every 4 h). Retentate (backbone-enriched fraction) and dialysate (branch-enriched fraction) were lyophilized separately for structural analysis.
2.3.7. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
Polysaccharide-KBr pellets (~2 mg sample:200 mg KBr) were analyzed on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 spectrometer (4000–400 cm⁻¹, 4 cm⁻¹ resolution, 32 scans).
2.3.8. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
Polysaccharides (30 mg) were deuterium-exchanged by three cycles of dissolution in D₂O and lyophilization. Samples were dissolved in 0.6 mL D₂O, centrifuged, and analyzed with 1.5 μL acetone as internal standard (δ<sub>H</sub> 2.29, δ<sub>C</sub> 31.5 ppm). ¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR, ¹H-¹H COSY, HSQC, and HMBC spectra were acquired on a Bruker AVANCE III 500 MHz spectrometer (25°C).

2.4. Biological Activity Assays
2.4.1. Cell Culture and Senescence Induction
Human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C under 5% CO₂. For senescence induction, cells at 60–70% confluence were treated with 1 μM doxorubicin for 48 h.
2.4.2. Cell Viability Assay
Cells (3×10³ cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates. After 24 h adherence, control groups received AM005-2 (0.25–1 mg/mL), while senescent groups were pre-induced with doxorubicin. Following 24 h incubation, cell viability was assessed by adding 10 μL CCK-8 reagent, incubating at 37°C for 1 h, and measuring absorbance at 450 nm. Results were normalized to untreated controls.
2.4.3. SA-β-gal Staining
Senescent cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (15 min, RT), washed with PBS, and stained with β-galactosidase kit solution (containing 1 mg/mL X-Gal) at 37°C overnight in the dark. Blue-stained cells were quantified under light microscopy, with senescence ratio calculated as (blue cells/total cells) × 100%.
2.4.4. Western Blot Analysis
Total proteins were extracted with RIPA buffer containing 1 mM PMSF and 1× protease/phosphatase inhibitors. After quantification (BCA assay), proteins (30 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked with 5% BSA/TBST (1 h, RT). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (P16:1:1000, P21:1:1000, GAPDH:1:5000) at 4°C overnight, then HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000, 1 h, RT). Bands were visualized by ECL and quantified with ImageJ (GAPDH normalization).
2.4.5. Target Identification by Biotin Labeling
Biotin-AM005-2 was synthesized by reacting 50 mg polysaccharide with CDI-activated biotin (49 mg biotin + 65 mg CDI in 2 mL DMSO, 50°C, 12 h, N₂), followed by TEA coupling (40 μL, pH 8.5, 75°C, 24 h).
